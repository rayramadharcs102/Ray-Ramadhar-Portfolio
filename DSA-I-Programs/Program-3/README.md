# Program 3 – Data Structures & Algorithms I

Description: This is a program that creates helper data structures
functions to the sortDataList function. It builds 
a struct Personandfirstchars that takes features from the 
pointer values, and the pointers themselves. It
then builds an array of these structs. It is then
determined if the T4 case or if T1, T2, T3 cases are 
relevant. If T4, it completes a radix sort, if not
it completes a standard sort using a comparator
and the sort function. This ultimately sorts the
nodes of a linked list.
